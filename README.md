## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Honestly, I faced many challenges., I feel like swift coding takes longer for me to get a hang of. IThe one persistance issue that i have ben facing is the random "&quot;" that I receive. Sometimes I had to start my code all over again because I forgot some steps. But besides that, I just had to be patient with myself.
